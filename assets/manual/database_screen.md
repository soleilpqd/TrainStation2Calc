- Input text into field **3** to filter items which contain the given text.
- Use checkmark **Enable** (**6**) to enable/disable item.
- Some products have factory on the map (so you don't need to produce in the factory at your station). Turn on checkmark **Minable** (**7**) if you have unlocked the product factory on the map.
- Use button **Reset** (**1**) to reset database to default.
- Use button **Enable by level** (**2**) to enable items based on your **level**. This also enables all the products **Minable** so you may have to manualy turn it off.
- User button **+** (**4**) to add your own item. The checkmark **Enable** (**6**) is replaced by **Delete** button (Your own item has not **Enable** property - it is always enabled).
- Tap on item icon (**5**) to change item icon.
